# SmartClient

The SmartClient is used to:

- Handle the launch from an EHR
  - Looks up well-known
  - Handles PKCE verification
  - Redirects to the FHIR authorization server
- Handle the callback after an authorized user returns from the FHIR authorization server
  - Verifies PKCE and state
  - Retrieves the access token, ID-token and refresh token as well as Smart on FHIR context
  - Refreshing tokens using the refresh token when needed
- Manage users sessions

## `class SmartClient(...)`

Normal usage of SmartClient, only needs to provide a sessionId and client configuration, as well as a backing store.

| Name      | Type                                                        | Description                                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| sessionId | string                                                      | Current users sessionId                            |
| storage   | [SmartStorage](./smart-storage.md)                          | Server side storage implementation                 |
| config    | [SmartClientConfiguration](./smart-client-configuration.md) | Smart on FHIR client configuration                 |
| options?  | [SmartClientOptions](./smart-client-options.md) \| null     | Options for enabling or disabling certain features |

## `class SmartClient(...)` (multi-launch mode)

To enable support for launching multiple sessions using the same sessionId, you need to instantiate the SmartClient with
an extra patient ID during initialization.

| Name     | Description                                        | Type                                                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| session  | Current sessionId and activePatient (if present)   | `{ sessionId: string, activePatient: string \| null }`                          |
| storage  | Server side storage implementation                 | [SmartStorage](./smart-storage.md)                                              |
| config   | Smart on FHIR client configuration                 | [SmartClientConfiguration](./smart-client-configuration.md)                     |
| options? | Options for enabling or disabling certain features | [SmartClientOptions](./smart-client-options.md) `& { enableMultiLaunch: true }` |

When multi-launch mode is enabled, when the client redirects to the final `redirectUrl`, it will include the `patient`
query parameter with the launched patients ID (FHIR). This must be parsed from the URL by the application and stored in
for example [sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage).

This ID _must_ be used in any subsequent instantiations of the SmartClient (and it's subsequent `.ready()` calls) to
ensure that each session is correctly associated with the launched patient.

An example of the typical flow when using multi-launch mode, steps 1-5 are normal, 6-8 are specific to multi-launch
mode:

1. EHR launches the application as normal
2. `sessionId` is generated by the application, and is set as a secure cookie
3. The application does a `smartClient.launch(...)`
4. User is redirected to the FHIR authorization server
5. The application handles the callback and uses `smartClient.callback()`
6. The web-application is launched with the `?patient=<id>` in the URL
7. The web-application retrieves the query parameter, stores it in `sessionStorage`, and removes it from the URL.
8. The web-application passes the patient ID (now in session storage) back to the server when the server needs to fetch
   any data, and the SmartClient is instantiated with both the sessionId (cookie) and activePatient (from session
   storage, passed to the server) and creates a `ReadyClient` scoped to that specific patient.
